# EtchASketch

A webpage that mimics the classic toy, Etch-A-Sketch. The user can place their mouse over the sketchpad and watch as the pad tracks their every movement, just like the dials on the real thing. Interactive buttons provide a user with the option to clear out the pad and change the amount of cells on the pad for more precise drawing!
